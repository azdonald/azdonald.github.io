Phew!!! Its a new year and with all that happened in the world last year, I'm so grateful my family and I made it this far.

Last year started really well for me then the world turned upside down due to the pandemic and it has not been the same again and might never be. This year like everyone else, I am a little bit cautious when making plans but I know it would be a great one( I'll tell you why later).

I wanted to improve my communication skills last year and I am not where I want to be so this year, I am going to make a conscious effort and hopefully track my progress monthly. I also wanted to be more proficient in Ruby/rails and Angular/typescript and I am ashamed to say I only achieved that in Angular.


For 2021, the plan is to read more books, put my phone down and improve my soft skills at work.  


Here's to a blissful 2021.
