At the start of 2017, I set a goal for myself: to read 50 books of which    
10 had to be Technical books  
4 had to be research papers.

At the end of 2017, I did not come close to achieving my aim but 2017 wasn't a failure rather I would call it a success. So what did I achieve in 2017?

I read 25 Novels (This is the most books I have ever read in a year including my school days).
I read a paper (From beginning to the end and understood some things).
I read some technical books (Finished 3).
I also became a became a better developer.


On a personal level, I moved from Lagos to Ottawa, proposed to my best friend and got a job via Reddit.


## 2018 Goals
For this year, I am ditching novels, I would be spending my free time understanding systems.

When I first started programming, there were 3 areas of programming I felt were for gods:  
Game Development  
OS Development  
Language Development

So last year when I discovered this book [Writing an Interpreter with Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) I was excited, I might finally be able to dine with the gods. I got the book last year and started reading when I moved to Ottawa and its so its awesome. If you ever want to know how Interpreters work without spending too much time reading theory you should get this book.

So my 2018 goal(professionally) is all about Compliers and Interpreters. I would be reading any book or paper I can get my hands on this year. By the time I am doing the 2018 review next year, I hope to know how Python works internally, how to construct a simple language and generally just be an all around better developer.

I also hope to write more frequently.

Cheers to a blissful 2018.
