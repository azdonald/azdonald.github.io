Well people we finally made it to 2020.

The goal or motto for this year is discipline. Last year was a good one personally and professionally but this year, I plan to accomplish a lot more than I did last year.


## 2020 Goals
###### Learn Ruby and Rails  
I changed jobs last year and Typscript(Angular 8) and Ruby are the two languages currently used at my place of work(I had never worked with either before). In my four months there, I already feel comfortable and productive with Angular while I feel so overwhemled when I have to work on the Ruby parts.

###### Become a better write and communicator  
If I have and dreams of making it to the top as a Software Enginner, I have to be very good at writing and excellent at verbal comminication. This is one skill I feel I am really lacking and I plan to tackle it head on this year.

###### Drink more water and get fit
I am a relatively healthy person but fit I am not. I signed up to play soccer with some friends last December and it has shown how unfit I am. 
I am going to address that this year by execising more, drinking way more water than I did last year and generally eating healthy.

I also hope to write more frequently.

Cheers to a blissful 2020.
